# SVG Creation Guide for Customs Edge

## Why This Folder is Empty
Your original assets from Gemini are **raster images** (PNG format), not vector graphics (SVG). True SVG files need to be created from scratch or converted using specialized tools.

## Options to Get SVG Files:

### 1. **AI Vectorization Tools** ⭐ (Recommended)
- **Adobe Illustrator**: Image Trace feature (best quality)
- **Vector Magic**: Online PNG to SVG conversion
- **Inkscape**: Free alternative with Trace Bitmap function

### 2. **Manual Recreation** 
- Recreate logos from scratch in:
  - Adobe Illustrator
  - Figma (free, web-based)
  - Inkscape (free, desktop)

### 3. **Request New Vectors from Gemini**
Ask Gemini to regenerate with specific prompts:
- "Create SVG vector versions of Customs Edge logo"
- "Generate as scalable vector graphics in SVG format"
- "Export as SVG with editable paths"

### 4. **Hybrid Approach** (Current Status)
Your PNG assets are perfectly suitable for web use:
- ✅ High resolution (up to 400×100 for retina)
- ✅ Optimized for performance
- ✅ Professional quality
- ✅ All required sizes generated

## When You Actually Need SVGs:
- **Print materials** at large sizes
- **Infinite scalability** requirements
- **Multi-color variations** (easier to edit)
- **Animation** purposes
- **Very small file sizes** (simple graphics only)

## Recommendation:
**Keep using your current PNGs** for web deployment. They're production-ready and will look great on all devices. Add SVGs later if you need them for specific use cases.

## Quick SVG Creation (If Needed):
1. Open your best PNG in Adobe Illustrator
2. Use "Image Trace" with "High Color" preset
3. Expand and clean up paths
4. Export as SVG
5. Optimize with SVGO tool
